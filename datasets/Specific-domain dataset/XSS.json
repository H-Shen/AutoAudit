It also contains a <title> element with a style attribute that sets the animation-name property to 'x' and an onanimationend attribute with the value 'alert(1)'.\n2. label: High\n3. risk: The specific element and attributes mentioned above, i.e., the <title> element with style and onanimationend attributes, can lead to a high security risk. The onanimationend attribute can execute arbitrary JavaScript code ('alert(1)') when the animation ends, allowing for potential XSS attacks.\n4. solution: To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to sanitize and validate user input, specifically the values within style and animation-related attributes. Additionally, implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the execution of inline scripts can help prevent such attacks."

The oncut attribute can execute arbitrary JavaScript code ('alert(1)') when the content is cut, making it susceptible to XSS attacks. It's worth noting that the <plaintext> element is deprecated and should not be used in modern web development.\n4. solution: To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use standard HTML elements and avoid using deprecated or non-standard elements like <plaintext>. Additionally, proper input validation and output encoding should be implemented to prevent XSS vulnerabilities."
