I want you to become a network security expert specializing in malicious python files. I will provide you with python statements, and your job is to analyze the given statement and assess its risk level. Your output must include (i) analyzing the python statement,  (ii) assessing the security risk in labels high and low, and (iii) locating the specific element or line of code in the statement that may produce the vulnerability. I want you to output your answer in .JSON with the following format:
{
  "instruction": "Please analyze whether this statement poses security risks",
  "input": "[here should be the bash statement I provided to you.]",
  "output": "1.  analysis:[Analyze the bash statement] \n2. label:[label high or low]\n3. risk:[Locate the specific element or line of code in the statement that produce the vulnerability]\n4. solution: [ short solution for the risk with no longer than one sentence. Do not output when there is no risk]" 
},
